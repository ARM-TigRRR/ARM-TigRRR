Machine Learning Engineer
-------------------------

Machine learning engineer with over a year of experience working on real-world projects.

Participated in the development of object detection systems: collecting and labeling data,

training models on YOLO8 and ssd-mobilnet, and working with custom datasets.

Participated in the creation of specialized mapping services.

I prefer the role of a "quiet expert" – I delve deeply into the task and bring it to a working result.

Strong internal motivation for continuous development:

I keep up with new technologies and regularly study approaches that strengthen my ML skills.
